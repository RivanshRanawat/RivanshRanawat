# 👋 Hii, I'm Rivansh Ranawat

I am building software and data analytics platforms with a strong focus on educational and operational use cases, starting with space and satellite systems.

## Expertise
Technical focus areas include backend development, data-intensive applications, system architecture, and space-oriented software workflows.

## Vision
I believe effective software should reduce complexity, improve understanding, and support real-world decision-making. With this principle, I am learning and building in parallel focusing on ground-based systems, data workflows, and system design while developing a long-term foundation in space systems and related disciplines.

## Let's connect
I am particularly interested in collaborating with educators, researchers, and institutions working at the intersection of technology, data, and space applications.
